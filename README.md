# Houses

MERN stack to manage house teams for a school.

This app is designed to pull students and teachers from various sources, although for the moment, just ManageBac.

It can then assign students to houses and offer ways for people to assign point criteria and then give points to students.

To do:

- Add an admin portal
  - User view with password reset and email notification option
  - Create/edit categories
  - Create/edit houses
  - Trigger certain API calls
- Fix the point form to get rid of the radio buttons
- Clear yearly points
