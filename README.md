# Houses

MERN stack to manage house teams for a school.

This app is designed to pull students and teachers from various sources, although for the moment, just ManageBac.

It can then assign students to houses and offer ways for people to assign point criteria and then give points to students.

To do:

- Add an admin portal
- Add student roles
- Find a better way to serve pictures
